Every iteration of the nested loops gains an extra constant-time operation when y = i + j; is added. Nevertheless, because of the nested loops, the algorithm's overall time complexity remains O(nÂ²), unaffected by this modification. The additional operation will result in a little increase in the total execution time, but it is negligible when compared to the time spent in the nested loops.
